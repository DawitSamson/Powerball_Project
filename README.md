## **🖨️ How does This Powerball Project Work?**
* The Powerball works differently from the real one like Mega Millions to get more chances to get favorite results. 
* The Powerball  includes two parts. 
* Part, one includes 5 numbers. These five numbers are white ball numbers, which are drawn randomly from 20 numbers from 1 to 20 inclusively - (1,2,3, 4, 5, … , 17,18,19, 20). 	
* Part two only has one number, the Powerball number, which is obtained randomly from 10 numbers (1,2,3,4, 5,6,7,8, 9,10).
* When This Project run or reloaded/refreshed, it would display today’s Powerball winning numbers, your lucky numbers, and display the result based on lucky numbers against Today’s Powerball winning numbers.
